# Cephaloplot

This folder includes companion functions to the CEPHALOPOD pipeline (<https://github.com/alexschickele/CEPHALOPOD>) to **extract, process and plot model outputs**.

The *Tutorial.qmd* Quarto document in the *scripts* folder gives detailed explanations and examples on how to use the different functions (data are standard outputs from Cephalopod but too large to be included in this repository).

| extract  | extract_prediction   | Extract projections for all models (ensemble = FALSE) or for an ensemble model (ensemble = TRUE) of either the models that passed the QC, or a specific list of models (variable model is indicated). When ensemble = FALSE, values are returned for each model, month, (varfactor) and grid cell: mean and standard deviation across bootstraps, normalized standard deviation (std / max mean in the model) and coefficient of variation (std/mean). When ensemble = TRUE, values are returned for each grid cell: mean and standard deviation (first calculated across bootstraps, then averaged over specified months and varfactors, then averaged over models), normalized standard deviation (std / max mean across models) and coefficient of variation (std/ mean) |
| category | predictor_categories | Associate a (subjective) broad category to each predictor - highly dependent on the format of predictor names                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
