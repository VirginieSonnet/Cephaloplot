# Cephaloplot

This folder includes companions functions to the Cephalopod pipeline (https://github.com/alexschickele/CEPHALOPOD) to **extract, process and plot model outputs**. 

The *Tutorial.qmd* Quarto documents gives detailed explanations and examples on how to use the different functions (data are standard outputs from Cephalopod but too large to be included in this repository).
